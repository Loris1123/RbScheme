# RbScheme

A Scheme implementation in Ruby.  
This is a project for my university.  

Start RbScheme with `ruby scheme.rb`

## What it can do (so far)
For now only simple calculations  in the known scheme-syntax are possible.  
`(+ 13 37)`  
`(- 13 37)`  
`(/ 13 37)`  
`(* 13 37)`  

You can also do multiple calculations at once with nested lists:  
`(+ (* 13 37) (- 4 2)) `
